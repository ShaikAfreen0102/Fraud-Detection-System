🛡️ Machine Learning Based Fraud Detection System

A Python-based machine learning project that detects fraudulent transactions using a trained classification model. This system analyzes transaction patterns and predicts whether they are fraudulent or legitimate.


🧠 About the Project

This repository contains a fraud detection system built using machine learning. The system trains a model on transactional data and predicts whether transactions are fraudulent or genuine. You can integrate this with dashboards, web apps, or APIs to assist in real-time fraud analysis and prevention.

🚀 Features

-  Trains a fraud detection model with machine learning
-  Predicts transaction legitimacy
-  ncludes preprocessing and model pipeline
-  Easy to use and extend for real-world applications
-  Model can be exported and reused

🧰 Tech Stack

- Python

- Jupyter Notebook / Python Scripts

- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

- joblib / pickle for model serialization

📊 Model & Dataset

This project uses machine learning classification to distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones. Typically:

Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding)

Training a classifier (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Evaluating accuracy & classification metrics
