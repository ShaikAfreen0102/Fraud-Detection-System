🛡️ Fraud-Detection-System

Machine Learning Based Fraud Detection System

A Python-based machine learning project that detects fraudulent transactions using a trained classification model. This system analyzes transaction patterns and predicts whether they are fraudulent or legitimate.

🧠 About the Project

This repository contains a fraud detection system built using machine learning. The system trains a model on transactional data and predicts whether transactions are fraudulent or genuine. You can integrate this with dashboards, web apps, or APIs to assist in real-time fraud analysis and prevention.

🚀 Features

✔️ Trains a fraud detection model with machine learning
✔️ Predicts transaction legitimacy
✔️ Includes preprocessing and model pipeline
✔️ Easy to use and extend for real-world applications
✔️ Model can be exported and reused

🧰 Tech Stack

Python

Jupyter Notebook / Python Scripts

pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

joblib / pickle for model serialization

📊 Model & Dataset

This project uses machine learning classification to distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones. Typically:

Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding)

Training a classifier (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Evaluating accuracy & classification metrics
